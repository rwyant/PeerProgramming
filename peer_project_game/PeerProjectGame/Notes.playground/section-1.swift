// Notes for the Peer Programming - A Game Assignment

import UIKit

/*

- Create a Player superclass
- Player has an "Attack" method which returns a tuple (message: String, damage: Int)
- Message is a message the player says during an attack
- Damage is the amount of damage that it does



- Create a GoodPlayer sub-class of Player
- GoodPlayer has a random number of attacks that is >= 2
- GoodPlayer has a "health" interger variable that defaults to 100
- GoodPlayer has an "isAlive" method that returns a Bool of true if the "health remains above 0) else, it returns a false.


- Create a BadPlayer sub-class of Player
- BadPlayer has a random number of attacks that is >= 2
- BadPlayer has a "health" interger variable that defaults to 100
- BadPlayer has an "isAlive" method that returns a Bool of true if the "health remains above 0) else, it returns a false.


- Create a Match class that takes 2 players during initialization
- The Match class has a "playGame()" method which pits each player against the other, alternating taking turns until one of the players is no longer alive. 
- At the end of the match, print out the winner



- Put one GoodPlayer against one BadPlayer and look at the results


- Give players names and print out those names before the match
